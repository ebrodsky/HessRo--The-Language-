            <h3>What is hessro?</h3>
            <p>Hessro is an esoteric programming language inspired by the brainf*ck language. The language is scanned by our javascript program in order to perform basic
                commands onto an array. Similar to brainf*ck, these commands are able to move a single iterator to different locations on the array, as well as change the data
                contained in the array.</p>
            
            <h3>Who is Rob Hess and why is he a programming language?</h3>
            <p>Rob Hess is our lovely, handsome professor for Web Developement at Oregon State University. For our final project in this class we decided to use his name to design
                a rudimentary programming language, because, well, uh... we can!</p>
            
            <h3>How can I learn to program in hessro?</h3>
            <p>It's actually quite simple. There are five commands you need to know to control the simple array:</p>
            <table>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Command</th>
                        <th>Explanation</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>rob</td>
                        <td>Moves the iterator to the right by 1</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>hess</td>
                        <td>Moves the iterator to the left by 1</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>ROB</td>
                        <td>Increments the data at the iterator's location by 1</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>HESS</td>
                        <td>Decrements the data at the iterator's location by 1</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>!robhess</td>
                        <td>Outputs the data at the iterator's location</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>+ROBHESS</td>
                        <td>Outsputs the value of the data at the current iterator plus that of the previous iterator</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>-ROBHESS</td>
                        <td>Outsputs the value of the data at the current iterator minus that of the previous iterator</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>hessro(someNumber)</td>
                        <td>sets the entire array to someNumber.</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <h3>Programming in hessro seems tedious, annoying, and unnecessary. How can this website be demonstrated for full credit
            without having to write my own program in your stupid language?</h3>
            <p>Never fear! We have example programs featured in our "Example Code" page. Simply navigate to the page, copy and paste our example code, and watch the magic.</p>
