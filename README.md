# HessRo--The-Language-
Final web design project in CS290

HessRo is a partially functional, almost turing complete language that's inspired by the language brainf-ck, dedicated to our teacher for CS290: Rob Hess. The website has example code, but for a better understanding look up how brainf-ck works, since HessRo's functionality is basically the same with slightly different syntax.
